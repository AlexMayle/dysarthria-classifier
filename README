To reproduce 100% accuracy result, run the following

	python main.py 2

After this, the weights will be saved to the /tmp directory,
after which you may reproduce the results without retraining
using the following. 

	python main.py 2 --restore 1

DISCLAIMER:
The new testing method is not implemented for the baseline yet. We'll see how
that fairs. I haven't tested the other LSTM modes either as of this writing (5/17/17).

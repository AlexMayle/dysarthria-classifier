\section{Related Work}
Carmichael et al \cite{carmichael2008combining} employed a multilayer perceptron to classify the different forms of Dysarthria using human speech. Unlike our work, however, the network inputs are assumed to come from a distribution of people known to have some form of Dysarthria. Prior to this, an effort was made to classify speakers into one of the categories of Dysarthria using the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessement of each patient as input \cite{enderby1980frenchay} \cite{carmichael2007introducing}. The more advanced topic of recognizing speech produced from someone with Dysarthria using RNN networks has also been investigated recently \cite{dys-speech-rec-1} \cite{dys-speech-rec-2}.
